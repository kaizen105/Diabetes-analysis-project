# ü©∫ Diabetes Readmission Prediction

This project explores the **US Diabetes Readmission dataset (~100k encounters, ~70k patients)** to understand hospital readmission patterns and build a predictive model. It covers the full data science pipeline: **data preparation, exploratory analysis, modeling, deployment, SQL insights, and Power BI dashboarding**.

## üîÑ Workflow

1. **Data Preparation**
   - Cleaned dataset by handling nulls and mistyped values (e.g., `?`).
   - Performed feature engineering, encoding, and fixed outliers/skewness.
   - Generated two datasets:
     - **Encoded dataset** ‚Üí for machine learning.
     - **Categorical dataset** ‚Üí for Power BI dashboard.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Conducted univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis.
   - Visualized patterns using histograms, bar charts, boxplots, and correlation heatmaps.
   - Key Insights:
     - Median hospital stay: **4 days** (most between 2‚Äì6 days).
     - Patients prescribed an average of **16 medications**, with some up to 81.
     - Most patients had **0 prior visits**, but a few had extremely high utilization (42 outpatient, 76 emergency, 21 inpatient visits).

3. **Modeling**
   - Trained Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost on both unbalanced and balanced data.
   - Used **SMOTE** to address class imbalance and hyperparameter tuning.
   - **Random Forest** achieved near-perfect scores (**F1 ‚âà 0.99**) but showed signs of **overfitting**.
   - **Logistic Regression (balanced with SMOTE)** gave more modest but **stable and interpretable results** (AUC ‚âà 0.61, F1 ‚âà 0.16).
   - ‚úÖ **Final Model Deployed:** Logistic Regression (balanced with SMOTE), saved as `best_model.pkl`.

4. **Deployment**
   - Built a **Streamlit web app** for live predictions.

5. **SQL Analysis**
   - Designed **10 SQL queries** to extract business insights from the dataset.  
   - Condensed findings:
     - **Readmission Rate:** ~35% of patients were readmitted (within or after 30 days).  
     - **Age Patterns:** Higher readmission rates in older age groups, especially 60+.  
     - **Insulin Impact:** Patients prescribed insulin showed higher likelihood of readmission.  
     - **Diagnosis Trends:** Chronic conditions like circulatory and respiratory diseases were most associated with frequent readmissions.  
     - **Hospital Utilization:** Patients with multiple prior visits (emergency or inpatient) had significantly higher readmission probability.

6. **Dashboarding**
   - Created an **interactive Power BI dashboard** to visualize readmission trends, age distributions, diagnosis patterns, and KPIs.
