🩺 Diabetes Readmission Prediction

This project explores the **US Diabetes Readmission dataset (~100k encounters, ~70k patients)** to analyze hospital readmission patterns and build a predictive model. It covers the full data science workflow: **data preparation, exploratory analysis, modeling, deployment, SQL insights, and dashboarding**.

## 🔄 Workflow

### 1. Data Preparation
- Cleaned nulls and mistyped values (e.g., `?`).  
- Performed feature engineering & encoding.  
- Fixed outliers and skewness.  
- Generated two datasets:
  - **Encoded dataset** → used for ML models.  
  - **Categorical dataset** → used for Power BI visualizations.  

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis.  
- Visualizations: histograms, bar plots, boxplots, correlation heatmap.  
- **Key findings:**
  - Median hospital stay: **4 days** (mostly 2–6 days).  
  - Average **16 medications** prescribed per patient (up to 81).  
  - Most patients had no prior visits, but some had very high utilization (42 outpatient, 76 emergency, 21 inpatient).  

### 3. Modeling
- Algorithms tested: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost.  
- Addressed imbalance using **SMOTE**.  
- Results:
  - **Random Forest** → F1 ≈ 0.99 but overfitted.  
  - **Logistic Regression (balanced with SMOTE)** → more stable, interpretable.  
- ✅ **Final Model Deployed:** Logistic Regression (SMOTE balanced).  

### 4. Deployment
- Built a **Streamlit web app** for predictions.  
- Run locally:  
  ```bash
  streamlit run streamlit_app/interface.py

### 5. SQL Insights

Wrote 10 SQL queries to answer analytical questions.
**Key insights extracted:**

* Overall **readmission rate: \~16%**.
* **60–80 age group** had the highest share of readmissions.
* **Circulatory & respiratory diseases** strongly associated with readmissions.
* **Emergency admissions** were the main source of readmitted patients.
* Gender split: **Male \~46%, Female \~54%**.

### 6. Dashboarding

* Designed an **interactive Power BI dashboard** to visualize:

  * Patient demographics
  * Readmission trends
  * Diagnosis distribution
  * Admission sources
* Dashboard file: `powerbi/dashboard.pbix`

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

* **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Imbalanced-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Deployment**: Streamlit
* **Database/Analysis**: SQL
* **Dashboarding**: Power BI

---

## 📊 Results

* **Final Model**: Logistic Regression (balanced with SMOTE).
* **Performance**: AUC ≈ 0.61, F1 ≈ 0.16 (test set).
* **SQL + Dashboard** provided insights into readmission drivers (age, diagnosis, insulin use, hospital source).
---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* Add model explainability (SHAP / LIME).
* Deploy to cloud (Heroku / AWS).
* Improve feature engineering (grouping diagnoses, medications).
